 ## The Need for design patterns:
 - Change is a constant in Software
	- Specifications.
	- Clients can change their minds.
	- Features can be added/removed.
	- You will always need to refactor a program to solve problems or fix bugs.
 
 - Design Patterns are ways really smart people before you have figured out how to build software that's flexible enough to handle constant change.
 
 ## What are design patterns?
 - Design Patterns are general solutions to common problems in software development.
 - Many problems in software development are related to how flexible and resilient a program is to change over the long run.
 - Ideally we want to write software that can easily have features added/removed  without unduly involving code that shouldn't be impacted by these changes?
 - For instance, by structuring our app properly we should be able to easily swap out `Core Data` for `Realm` without having to rebuild most of our application in the process?
 - Design patterns are generalized guidelines that apply regardless of the specific domain.
 - So they are the same in, say, game development as they are in an e-commerce app.
 - Design Patterns are general solutions on how best to structure your objects.
 - The area of design patterns trace their origins to the book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by a group of 4 authors referred to as The Gang of Four.

 - This book talks about 23 patterns. These have been extended since.
 - Design patterns give you a shared vocabulary.
 - Design patterns give you ideas about how to build good software because you can see how some of the best developers have solved problems.
 - Using design patterns is reusing the experience of other developers.
 - I'm going to cover some classical design patterns today many of the examples are taken from the Head First Book: `Design Patterns`.
